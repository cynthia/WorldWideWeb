<TITLE>Features & Bug Fixes for  WorldWideWeb on the NeXT</TITLE>
<NEXTID 10>
<H1>Features and Bug Fixes</H1>The following are features added to the <A NAME=0 HREF=../WorldWideWeb.html>WWW app on the NeXT</A> with time,
in reverse chronological order. See also the outstanding <A NAME=1 HREF=Bugs.html>bug list</A>
. Credits in brackets are to those who mailed me with the bug reports,
to whom thanks.<P>
 
<H2>To be released: version 0.13</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Search panel appears automatically when an index is the main window
and disappears otherwise. The panel appears in the top right hand
corner to be out of the way of document windows. The Cmd-F key and
menu item are unnecessary.
<LI>The "Open from hypertext reference" text is automatically loaded with
the address of the main window as a default. This can be picked up
and pasted into mail, etc.
<LI>Bug fix:  Plain text windows don't get distortions in the vertical
positioning of scan lines when you scroll them any more.
<LI><A NAME=9>Bug fix</A>: Inability to access cs.orst.edu. WWW used the FTP "PASV"
command when picking up remote files - some servers (eg cs.orst.edu)
don't support this. Now it doesn't - it uses "PORT" instead, which
is mandatory for servers. (Ira Fuchs)
<LI>Bug fix: Failed attempts to load remote files now only produce one
Alert panel instead of two one after the other. (Ira H Fuchs)
<LI>Bug fix: Loading a newsgroup with no articles in crashed the application.
Now it doesn't. Also, title bar "Connecting..." no longer left up
once the connection has succeeded. (Ira H. Fuchs )
<LI>Info->Panel is now not editable. (Michael D Mellinger )
</UL>
<H2>19 Aug 91 version 0.12</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bug fix: .rtf files were loaded as plain text. ( burchard@horizon.math.utah.edu
(Paul Burchard) )
<LI>Default.html file shipped with the .app now has absolute references,
and so will work on a remote site. (many people!)
</UL>
<H2>15 Mar 91 version 0.11</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Feature: If a file is not available locally, or mounted under /Net/hostname/...,
the WWW will attempt to pick it up by anonymous FTP giving user@host
as password. (Currently the user name given is always "user"!)
<LI>Bug fix: If one didn't have a personal home file, two error messages
would be given on startup. Now the system default is loaded without
complaint. (Bug introduced at <A NAME=8 HREF=#7>version 0.9</A> )
</UL>
<H2>4 April 91 version 0.10</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bug fix: A dummy window created when following a link to a different
application would cause crashes if it was resized, or  if the link
was followed a second time..
</UL>
<H2>3 April 91 version 0.9</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bug fix: Closing a window which has been edited now prompts for a
save as it should. <A NAME=7>Alert panels</A> have been introduced for some file
system, communication and server errors.
<LI>Bug fix: One can now edit files to which one has group access.	
</UL>
<H2>26 March 91 version 0.8</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Changed anchor highlighting from dark grey to underline, now underline
is available. (I may make underline &/or colour a user preference
or style later.)
<LI>Modified paragraph spacing so that dummy spaces are not introduced
between two paragraphs neither or which are "Normal" style. Also,
now,  the space allowed is the larger of the "space before" the next
paragraph and the "space after" the preceding paragraph, rather than
the sum. Text is generally more compact.
<LI>Bug fix: A few memory leaks removed with the aid of the excellent
MallocDebug utility.
<LI>Feature: When a new file is made, it is given a default title generated
from the filename, irrespective of the title of the template.
<LI>Fixed version 2 bug: The last run of a bit of text would have its
formating information  overwritten by the previous run's format. Bug
was in v2 [Text rebewRuns:text:frame:tag] not called any more.
<LI>Fixed version 2 bug: Typing within anchor would produce non-anchor
text, breaking the paragraph up when the docuement was saved and reloaded.
(Not 100% tested)
<LI>Version 2 enhancements came for free: Spell checking, "Windows" menu,
"Services" menu. "File" (was "Window") menu is now renamed "Document".
Also, random crashes seem to have disappeared since V2 (touch wood).
<LI>Bug fix: Newly created windows can be edited the moment you have given
a filename for them to be stored in: the bug which made them uneditable
has been removed.
<LI>Bug fix: No longer crshes when paragraph formatting a selection including
the last character.
<LI>Bug fix: The restyling of text can only occur if document is editable.
It sets the document "edited".
</UL>
<H2>19 March 91 Version 0.7</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The annoying vertical fidgeting on loading a new window has been removed.
<LI>"<A NAME=2 HREF=../../hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Menus.html#27> Print</A> " and "<A NAME=3 HREF=../../hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Menus.html#29> Page layout</A> " menu items have been added. Page layout
maintains the "PageType" default in the NXDefaults database, so it
is persisent between invokations. 
<LI>"<A NAME=4 HREF=../../hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Menus.html#39> Help</A> " and "<A NAME=5 HREF=../../hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Menus.html#47> Open master template</A> " menu items added.
<LI>"Window" menu renamed "File" to match v2.0 standards.
<LI>"<A NAME=6 HREF=../../hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Menus.html#46> Link to File</A> " menu item allows direct link to files of this or
any other application. (Not directories).
<LI>Opening remote mounted hypertext files from the workspace now gives
them the correct hypertext address, so that links made to them will
be correct. 
</UL>
<H2>1 Feb 91 Version 0.5</H2>
<UL>
<LI>"New file" and "Link to New" and "Unlink" implemented.
<LI>"Address" style implemented in HTML  "ADDRESS" tags.
<LI>Bug fix: Long relative pathnames now treated properly.
</UL>
<H2>30 Jan 91 Version 0.4 </H2>
<UL>
<LI>Save and open panels have reasonable suggested filenames, and correct
directories.
<LI> If one creats an anchor the node becomes "edited". One cannot create
anchors in unwritable nodes.
<LI>The "editable" status of a file is deduced from its protection, uid,
etc.
<LI>The translation between local filenames of remote files and backnow
works properly.
<LI>Save in RTF or plaintext format now supported.
<LI>Bug fix: No longer crashes on Cmd/W.
